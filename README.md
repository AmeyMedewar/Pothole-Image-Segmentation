# Pothole-Image-Segmentation
The Pothole Image Segmentation project aims to develop a robust model for detecting and segmenting potholes in images and video feeds. Utilizing the YOLOv8-seg architecture, this project harnesses advanced instance segmentation techniques to accurately identify and outline potholes in various environments.
