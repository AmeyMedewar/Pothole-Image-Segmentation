# Pothole Image Segmentation

## Description

The **Pothole Image Segmentation** project aims to develop a robust model for detecting and segmenting potholes in images and video feeds. Utilizing the YOLOv8-seg architecture, this project harnesses advanced instance segmentation techniques to accurately identify and outline potholes in various environments. 

### Features:
- **Real-Time Detection**: Achieves efficient segmentation with minimal latency, suitable for real-world applications.
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tunes a pre-trained model on a specific dataset of pothole images, enhancing accuracy and performance.
- **Dataset Augmentation**: Implements various augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Conducts thorough performance assessments using standard metrics to ensure reliability.

### Use Cases:
- **Road Maintenance**: Assists city planners and engineers in identifying road damages for timely maintenance.
- **Smart City Applications**: Integrates with smart city frameworks to monitor and manage road conditions in real-time.

### Installation
